# machinelearning

Hello and welcome!

This is Jia Dong, and I am not a developer. My goal is to gain an understanding of machine learning (ML) and explore how ML/AI can be utilized to enhance business operations in terms of speed and efficiency.

Before we proceed, here's a bit of background information:

This folder contains Python code that has been implemented for assignments as part of my ML certification on Coursera.

A. The majority of the code within each assignment file has been provided by Coursera, including the plots, library setups, and data. However, there are sections programmed by me and denoted by comments from "Start Code Here" to "End Code Here" that have been designed to test key learning points.

B. The code has been updated by me to ensure it can be executed in a Python environment, as Coursera's content is primarily presented in Jupyter notebooks.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know: jia.dong@alumni.usc.edu

Best,
Jia Dong
