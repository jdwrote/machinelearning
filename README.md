# machinelearning

Hello and welcome!

This is Jia Dong, and I am not a developer. I am PM and my goal is to gain an understanding of machine learning (ML) and explore how ML/AI can be utilized to enhance business operations in terms of speed,efficiency, quality and scale.

Before we proceed, here's a bit background:

This folder contains Python codes that have been implemented for assignments as part of my ML Coursera certification.

A. The majority of the code within each assignment file has been provided by Coursera, including plots, library setups, and data. However, there are sections programmed by me, denoted by comments from "Start Code Here" to "End Code Here".

B. The code has been updated by me to ensure it can be executed in a Python environment, as Coursera's content is presented in Jupyter notebooks.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know: jia.dong@alumni.usc.edu

Best,
Jia Dong
