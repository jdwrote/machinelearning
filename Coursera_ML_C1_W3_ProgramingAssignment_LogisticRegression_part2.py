# - [ 3 - Regularized Logistic Regression](#3)
# In this part of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression to predict
# whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA).
# During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.

# 3.1 Problem Statement
# Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests.
# From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected.
# To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.

# load dataset
X_train, y_train = load_data("./ex2data2.txt")

# print X_train
print("X_train:", X_train[:5])
print("Type of X_train:",type(X_train))

# print y_train
print("y_train:", y_train[:5])
print("Type of y_train:",type(y_train))

print ('The shape of X_train is: ' + str(X_train.shape))
print ('The shape of y_train is: ' + str(y_train.shape))
print ('We have m = %d training examples' % (len(y_train)))

# Plot examples
plot_data(X_train, y_train[:], pos_label="Accepted", neg_label="Rejected")

# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Microchip Test 2')
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Microchip Test 1')
plt.legend(loc="upper right")
plt.show()

#   - [ 3.3 Feature mapping](#3.3)

# One way to fit the data better is to create more features from each data point.
# In the provided function map_feature, we will map the features into all polynomial terms of  ùë•1 and  ùë•2
# up to the sixth power.

print("Original shape of data:", X_train.shape)

mapped_X =  map_feature(X_train[:, 0], X_train[:, 1])
print("Shape after feature mapping:", mapped_X.shape)

# Let's also print the first elements of X_train and mapped_X to see the tranformation.
print("X_train[0]:", X_train[0])
print("mapped X_train[0]:", mapped_X[0])



# While the feature mapping allows us to build a more expressive classifier, it is also more susceptible to overfitting.
# In the next parts of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression to fit the data
# and also see for yourself how regularization can help combat the overfitting problem.
